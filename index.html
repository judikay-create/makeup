        <h3>Techniques on how to apply a perfect make-up</h3>
        <p>While many people may not appreciate the art ofmake-up for what it
        make-up is considered an art form. Just take a look at all the artistic elements 
        and tools that are used in make-up artistry. Covering your blemishes is not art,
        nor is drawing out your eyebrows exactly the same as the model on Instagram. However when make-up is 
        used for drag, costume and Theatre,it can be considered as an art as it is part of a peformance/act and is used to express the character. </p>

    <div class="technique">
        <h3>What is the essence of make-up?</h3>
        <p>Some make-up increaser their beauty, making them feel more confident because it covers
        up blemishes. The essence of make-up is too diverse and can't be overlooked still; because it's applied to
        some to be a major source of income, most importantly wealth to others. The make-up industry in General is too wide.
        </p>
        <p>We have make-up industries that generate billions of dollars for make-up business mogul; this is to tell you or let
        you know that people actually are very much invested in the make-up business. I have seen videos on the internet of people
        crying due to loss or damage of their make-up project. For some, it's not just a make-up product, they get attached to them and
        we have the l'oreal who has made billions of dollars from the make-up products.
        </p>
        <p>There are some negative reviews on make-up. Some people feel like it's not natural. it's a waste of time or it's catfishing while others
        battle with fake products which as a result give them reactions which maybe burning sensation,itchhing,dry patches, swelling and
        so many other reations, but that doesn't change the positive impact it has and how it's a huge source of income for some people
        both male and female.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Products</h3>
        <p>
            There are some affordable and expensive make-up products you can get. But sometimes it's hard to get an autentic product due to the 
            big market for it. We have huge industries like Procter
            and Gamble, fenty, hudabeauty, la girl cosmetics, unilever, and so many big brands.
        </p>
        <p>
            Make-up products plays a very essential role for make-up artist because they can't work
            without their product.
        </p>
        <p>
            A good make-up product creates unshakeable customer loyalty that generates increased
            leads. When customers find a product they trust they return make repeat purchases and
            recommend the product or services to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Creating quality products will continue to be the most important thing to customers.

    <h3>Skin</h3>
    <p>This plays a vital role in out everyday life, with or without the make-up a good skincare routine
        is always very needed. Most make-up won't look or stay long if the face isn't well primed or well
        moisturized.</p>
    <p>As a make-up artist you need to understand your client's skin if it's oily or dry, so you can know
        how to prep it. A good skin brings excellent result for a client's make-up.
    </p>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <p>To achieve any good work for your make-up you need to know your client's shade of make-up
        before applying it on your client, we have diverse skin color and shade of Foundation and
        knowing if your client's face goes with oily Foundation or matte makes it better.. And in other to
        get a more natural look for make-up you must always ensure as a make-up artist that you blend
        it into your model neck, you don't want to have the face looking different from the neck,
        sometimes the client might not have a perfect tone; the face might have a lighter shade from the
        neck or the neck might have a lighter shade from the face.
    </p>
    <h3>Concealer</h3>
    <p>The Concealer is mainly to cover up the undereye or most times to cover up dark spots. We
        have different shades for different skin colors.. We always use a shade lighter from the person's
        skin. And the concealer plays a major role in defining our eyebrows.
    </p>
    <h3>Powder</h3>
    <p>This is the solid form of our liquid Foundation. it's help to keep the liquid Foundation from
        looking shiny and also to help from breakout, some people prefer to just apply the powder even
        without the foundation most times for personal use.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting powder</h3>
    <p>The setting powder is most times used by professionals to achieve a full face glam by
        make-up artists.. Its has to be done well still not to have flash back when you snap. The Setting
        powder can also be used for diverse means. To prep your eyebrows or even oily face and so
        much more.</p>
    <h3>Eye and lip</h3>
    <p>The eye make-up is so sensitive for some because they don't want to lose their eyesight.
        There are some products in our make-up that can affect the eyes. The eyes also are the main
        beauty of the make-up, the lashes, the diverse colors and the eyeliner when done properly can
        transform one's look. The lower waterline, lower lashline, lid for eyeshadow, upper lashline,
    inner Conner,crease and above crease etc.</p>
    <h3>Lip</h3>
    <p>The lip has to be moisturized before applying any lipstick because if the lip is dry it can tear up
        the Lip.. Before applying lipstick the lip has to be moisturized with lip balm to make it smooth
        and soft. The Lip is the beauty of any authentic make-up achieved by a make-up artist. We have
        lipstick pencils, the lipgloss lip look" we also have amazing make-up lip stains of diverse colors,
        the one that suits the client very well. You can also use the concealer to achieve a well defined
        and neat lip for your client.</p>
        <h3>Blush and Highlights</h3>
        <p>Blush is very essential, and still people don't like it, while others love it. Their make-up routine
        can't be complete without it. Blush is very essential for any good make-up but too much of it can
        be very scary and or when not properly done can be terrible to look at. Blush should be part of
        any good make-up.
   </p>
        <h3>Highlights</h3>
        <p>The highlights help define the client face, it brings out the glowing effect of our model and
        beautifies the cheekbones, it can also be applied on the bridge of the nose most times on your
        brow bone or even the tear dot of the eye. You can also apply to the forehead or Cupid bow lips.
